# Hello!! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hVa6t0WpoDOk7Pxb7l/giphy.gif" width="50">
<br/>
My name is Amir Bredy, I am a New Graduate Computer Science Major from the illustrious Howard University. I love exploring new technology and enhancing the efficiency of old tech. This past summer, I spent time working as a Product Management intern @ Microsoft where I was honing my Product Management and Software Engineering skills working in the Enterprise and OS Security team working on the intersection between AI and Security. I am current slated to start Full-Time this summer at Microsoft as a Product Manager within the Azure Edge + Platform Organization. I’m also looking to collaborate on exciting projects that can change the lives of others!
